## **MCU Data Logger ‚Äì PCB Design with KiCad**  

### **Project Overview**  
This project is an **MCU-based Data Logger** designed to improve my skills in PCB design and embedded systems. The PCB was developed using **KiCad**, incorporating key components for reliable data logging and real-time tracking. This project helped me refine my understanding of component placement, routing, and communication protocols.  

### **Key Features**  
‚úÖ **2-Layer PCB Design** ‚Äì Created and optimized using KiCad.  
‚úÖ **Microcontroller** ‚Äì ATmega328P-AU for processing and control.  
‚úÖ **Non-Volatile Storage** ‚Äì 24LC1025 EEPROM for data logging.  
‚úÖ **Real-Time Clock** ‚Äì DS1337 RTC for accurate timekeeping.  
‚úÖ **Communication Interfaces** ‚Äì Supports UART, SPI, and I2C for flexibility.  
‚úÖ **GPIOs for Expansion** ‚Äì Designed with future scalability in mind.  
‚úÖ **3D PCB Visualization** ‚Äì Front, back, and combined views for better insights.

## **Project Flow**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Microcontroller (ATmega328P-AU)**  
   - Handles all system operations and manages communication.  
   - Reads and writes data to EEPROM for storage.  
   
2Ô∏è‚É£ **RTC Module (DS1337)**  
   - Provides accurate timestamps for logged data.  
   - Communicates via I2C with the MCU.  
   
3Ô∏è‚É£ **EEPROM Storage (24LC1025)**  
   - Stores logged data persistently.  
   - Connected over I2C for data transfer.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Communication Interfaces**  
   - **UART**: Serial communication for debugging/logging.  
   - **SPI & I2C**: Expandability for additional peripherals.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Power Management & PCB Layout**  
   - Designed for stable operation with proper power routing.  
   - Optimized signal paths to reduce interference and improve reliability.
